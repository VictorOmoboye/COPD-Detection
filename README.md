# CHRONIC OBTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE DETECTION
## Using Machine and Deep Learning Algorithms 
This project aims to develop an advanced, non-invasive diagnostic tool for the early detection of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) using machine learning and medical sound recording technologies. By leveraging machine learning models such as CNNs,Random Forests, Logistic Regression, and Gradient Boosting Machines.
